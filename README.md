ðŸ‘‹ Holaa, Iâ€™m @eddthekidd. I am a Computer Engineer graduated from Far Eastern University Institute of Technology, professionally I reside in the Philippines and working as a CAD Engineer in Nimbyx.

ðŸ‘€ I have a strong interest in embedded systems, particularly hardware-related technologies such as drones. However, coding also fascinates me. Over time, this curiosity has evolved into a true passion, shaped
    by a trait I developed from a young age. As a naturally curious child, I loved taking things apart, closeley examining their components, and constantly wondering, "How does this work?" After satisfying my 
    curiosity, I would carefully reassemble everything. this habit significantly sharpened my problem-solving skills, especially in the technical aspects of my work. It also taught me that any problem can be solved
    if approached from a different perspective.

ðŸŒ± I am currently learning to build a portfolio using JavaScript as my primary language. I started this project for fun, but it also serves as a way to review and reinforce my programming skills. It allows me 
    to apply my coding knowledge beyond hardware-related technologies. Additionally, this portfolio will play a key role in my job applications and future career opportunities, providing a visually appealing way 
    to showcase the skills and experiences listed on my resume.

âš¡ Fun fact: 
      Ooooh, let me expand you vocabulary with this one: I consider myself a multipotentialite or polymath because I have a deep passion for exploring various fields that spark my curiosity. From aerospace 
      mechanisms and mechanical components to animals and plants, I enjoy immersing myself in different subjects, often spending hours learning simply out of fascination. A multipotentialite 
      or polymath is someone with a diverse range of interests who does not confine themselves to mastering just one discipline, and I strongly resonate with that definition.
